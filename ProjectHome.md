This project is to develop a platform for mobile devices like mobile phone, tablet and laptop. It treat a mobile device as a directory inside the whole distributed file system. User with proper privilege can access another mobile device like browsing a directory in the local machine. Remote user can manage files, sensors and location resources the same as they do it locally. Social networking are included to make it much more easy to handle resources among friends.

**After a careful thought, I think this project is worth being extended as a part of our lab's mobile learning infrastructure. We are now starting working on the design and implementation again after being quiet for a while. Hopefully, we will be done in this summer with a**simple and easy**Uno. (04/21/2012)**
